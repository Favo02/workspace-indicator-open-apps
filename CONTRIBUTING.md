## Commit Message Convention

Please follow the commit message format for the commits. Each commit message should consist of a type, scope (optional), and a summary: `type(scope): summary`.

- Type: `build`, `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`
- Scope: The affected component or module: `extension` or `settings`
- Summary: A brief description of the change

Example: `feat(extension): add drag and drop feature`

## Code Style

Please make sure to follow the existing code style and conventions when making changes to the codebase. Some guidelines:

- use 2 spaces for indentation
- use double quotes for strings (`"example"`)
- do not use semicolons (`;`) at the end of the line
- use snake case for variable and function names (`my_variable`, `my_function()`)
- the name of each _"private"_ function should start with an underscore (`_my_function()`)
- add a comment before each function explaining its purpose (JSDoc style)
